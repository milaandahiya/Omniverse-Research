# SMU-Omniverse

Download Omniverse from here: https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/download/. Once you have Omniverse running, go to the exchange tab and install the Create app.

Universal Scene Description (USD) is the primary scene descriptor used by Nvidia Omniverse.

Nvidia built a branch of Blender v4.0 (currently in alpha) with improved USD exporting functionality. You can download it at: https://builder.blender.org/download/experimental/universal-scene-description/ and select the version for your operating system.

This guide from Nvidia shows you the processs for exporting a USD file from Blender (v3.6 but still applicable) and importing it to Omniverse: https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/con_connect/con_connect/blender.html. The documentation for exporting this from Blender is here: https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/4.0/files/import_export/usd.html.

You may also use the Nvidia Nucleus connector in Omniverse to import/export USDs to a local or remote Omniverse server: https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/con_connect/con_connect/blender/nucleus-connector.html#blender-nucleus-connector
